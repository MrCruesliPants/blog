The final three matches are set up beautifully. The rivalries, the ambitions and dreams of the most important players, the drama - everything's there. I'm really looking forward to both Wakashimazu and Genzo returning for the final - will Hyuga be able to score at all?<br  />

I'm very happy with the show at this point. Sure, I'd like more non-match scenes, but the show is honest about what it is and I'm appreciating it for this. I can't predict at all how the final between Meiwa and Nankatsu (I'm guessing!) will end and if there will be some sort of time skip after the tournament.<br  />
</p>

<p>
If I had to predict something, I would say Nankatsu beats Meiwa in the final and Tsubasa does go to Brazil for two to three years and the show picks up when he returns. Hyuga will accept the offer from Tohou, I believe they have already decided for him but want to see how far they can push him.<br  />

It's the perfect episode of Captain Tsubasa. In the first semifinal Furano FC of Hokkaido clashes with Hyuga's Meiwa FC. Here's the perfect amount of drama, which quickly swayed me from rooting for one side to the other and back. Furano's strength is in its teamplay, relying on one another and working hard for their goal of winning this tournament.<br  />

<p>
We know a little bit about Hyuga's deep motivation to win already, but Furano's dedication is not to be underestimated and portrayed perfectly when their captain Hikaru Matsuyama let's himself intentionally get hurt by Hyuga to draw the penalty shot.<br  />

Quickly, however, we feel with Hyuga, sitting exhausted by himself on a chair at halftime. As Meiwa's coach Kozo Kira says, the young Takeshi Sawada is the key player to this match. We see more of Sawada's backstory, how Hyuga supported him despite Takeshi's young age. "Age has nothing to do with soccer!" is a great moment for Hyuga in this show so far. We see Kozo personally training Takeshi and understand that he has as hard for this tournament as everyone else.<br  />

<p>
As the match continus we see that Ken Wakashimazu has changed into his uniform on the sidelines. What more could I want out of this series?<br  />
