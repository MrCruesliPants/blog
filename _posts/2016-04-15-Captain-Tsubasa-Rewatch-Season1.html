Over the next months (years?) I'm going to rewatch Captain Tsubasa. I plan to make a few notes on every episode, that will hopefully lead to a larger, more focused article about the show later on.<br  />

<p>
This is a great first episode for a show that we now know became a massive success. Tsubasa is immediately likeable and the stage for the first challenge - Tsubasa vs. Genzo - was expertly set. I can feel excitement about wanting to know whether Tsubasa can score a goal on Genzo.<br  />

With this episode, we get a good idea for the direction of the next 10(?) episodes: Tsubasa will train with Nankatsu's team to prepare for their match with Genzo's team at Shutetsu. Tsubasa's reasoning for his choice to go to Nankatsu is interesting: He feels that he can learn most from having Genzo as his rival.<br  />

I look forward to the team building and training of Tsubasa's team, but I can't predict what role Roberto Hongo will play. He is an excellent player for sure, but how well will he be able to teach?<br  />

The first episode I <i>really</i> liked. We learn a lot about Roberto Hongo and his reasons for wanting to mentor Tsubasa are acceptable enough. I almost missed how Hongo, although he has played professionally for Brazil, calls Japan his native country. That explains him speaking the language and also having such an interest in Tsubasa!<br  />
</p>

<p>
The montage of how the Nankatsu players are sneaking out of the houses and shops of their parents is adorable. In the training match with Nishigaoka we see the first appearance of another player (Hanji Urabe) who I think will become important later on. The ending, with Nankatsu's team walking home against the setting sun is absolutely beautiful and makes me very happy I picked this show for a rewatch.</p>
