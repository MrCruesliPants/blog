Over the next months (years?) I'm going to rewatch Captain Tsubasa. I plan to make a few notes on every episode, that will hopefully lead to a larger, more focused article about the show later on.<br  />
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">01 - 大空へはばたけ</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
This is a great first episode for a show that we now know became a massive success. Tsubasa is immediately likeable and the stage for the first challenge - Tsubasa vs. Genzo - was expertly set. I can feel excitement about wanting to know whether Tsubasa can score a goal on Genzo.<br  />
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">02 - 燃えろサッカー小僧</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
With this episode, we get a good idea for the direction of the next 10(?) episodes: Tsubasa will train with Nankatsu's team to prepare for their match with Genzo's team at Shutetsu. Tsubasa's reasoning for his choice to go to Nankatsu is interesting: He feels that he can learn most from having Genzo as his rival.<br  />
</p>

<p>
I look forward to the team building and training of Tsubasa's team, but I can't predict what role Roberto Hongo will play. He is an excellent player for sure, but how well will he be able to teach?<br  />
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">03 - 明日に向って、キック・オフ</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
The first episode I <i>really</i> liked. We learn a lot about Roberto Hongo and his reasons for wanting to mentor Tsubasa are acceptable enough. I almost missed how Hongo, although he has played professionally for Brazil, calls Japan his native country. That explains him speaking the language and also having such an interest in Tsubasa!<br  />
</p>

<p>
The montage of how the Nankatsu players are sneaking out of the houses and shops of their parents is adorable. In the training match with Nishigaoka we see the first appearance of another player (Hanji Urabe) who I think will become important later on. The ending, with Nankatsu's team walking home against the setting sun is absolutely beautiful and makes me very happy I picked this show for a rewatch.<br  />
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">04 - ボールは友だち</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
Taro promises to be an interesting character, possibly someone who loves football as much as Tsubasa? Genzo's determination is emphasized once again, but I hope he can soon transform his desperate fixation on beating Tsubasa into more positive aspirations.<br  />
</p>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/posts/tsubasa/tsubasa-season1-episode4.jpg" width="90%" style="display:block;margin:2em auto 2em;"/>

<p>
There was a small detail in Genzo's training montage, where in the frame he's wearing gloves where in the other he isn't. I wonder if it's an oversight or intentionally implying that he's practicing with and without gloves.<br  />
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5">05 - ライバルはどこだ</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
The build-up of this episode is perfect. I'm just really excited to see how this match will go. Tsubasa playing as sweeper is interesting, but I would be surprised if this the only strategy that Hongo has prepared with Nankatsu's team.<br  />
</p>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/posts/tsubasa/tsubasa-season1-episode5.jpg" width="90%" style="display:block;margin:2em auto 2em;"/>

<p>
I remember watching the short scene in which Tsubasa is competing in the 200m sprint with his ball (and wins!) when I was young. It's a pretty minor event in the overall story, but back then it left a huge impression for me. I loved running maybe more than Tsubasa and I was so surprised to see how he could run so fast with a soccer ball.<br  />
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-6">06 - ゴールをかためろ</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
So, here we are: A full episode for one half-time of a game. I don't mind it though and expect it to get even "worse", I can easily imagine three full episode for one match.<br  />
</p>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/posts/tsubasa/tsubasa-season1-episode6.jpg" width="90%" style="display:block;margin:2em auto 2em;"/>

<p>
Genzo seems to be getting more and more bitter. While Tsubasa is thriving on the rivalry with him, Genzo seems almost scared and desperate. The end of the episode shows the most determined and sincere Tsubasa we have seen so far - <i>he wants to win!</i> All in all, this is probably one of the weaker episodes so far. I wonder if I just don't like the games as much?<br  />
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-7">07 - 運命のロングシュート</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<p>
Ishizaki's moment of courage. I really like that he is in fact remaining the captain of the team - he was somewhat joking about that before. His courage and determination enable Nankatsu's equalizer.<br  />
</p>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/posts/tsubasa/tsubasa-season1-episode7.jpg" width="90%" style="display:block;margin:2em auto 2em;"/>

<div id="outline-container-sec-8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-8">08 - さわやかコンビ誕生</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-8">
<p>
A great episode! Finally Genzo is starting to show some positive character development, taking responsibility and leading his team. Much more important than scoring the 2-1 goal, was his acting as captain encouraging and directing his teammates.<br  />
</p>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/posts/tsubasa/tsubasa-season1-episode8.jpg" width="90%" style="display:block;margin:2em auto 2em;"/>

<p>
That Taro would already join this game came a bit of a surprise to me. I like him well enough and the teacher constantly pointing out how cute he is added some humor, especially if she's going to get into some sort of competition with Anego over who is cuter: Taro or Tsubasa.<br  />
</p>

<p>
We're down 3 episodes for a single match, I do hope it's going wrap up the game next episode, but I have a feeling it won't be that easy. I'm somewhat worried about the standard the show is setting with this - here it's only a local school tournament, but how much more epic could, say, a national final get? Ten, fifteen, twenty episodes!?<br  />
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-sec-9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-9">09 - ラストチャンスにかけろ</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-9">
<p>
The match ends in a draw! All around good moments, the students cheering for the players of their school team, the moment of sportsmanship after the final whistle and Tsubasa thanking Anego's troupe for their support.<br  />
</p>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl  }}/assets/images/posts/tsubasa/tsubasa-season1-episode9.jpg" width="90%" style="display:block;margin:2em auto 2em;"/>

<p>
I'm excited for what's about to come. I honestly don't really need a Tsubasa-Genzo or even Nankatsu-Shutetsu rematch, but I'm rather excited for new teams with new players at the national tournaments!<br  />
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-10" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-10">10 - 夢はブラジルへ</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-10">
<p>
I must admit I'm a bit confused. Tsubasa will leave with Roberto to go Brazil, but only after playing in the national tournament? And he won't play with Nankatsu but with the selection team (assuming he gets picked)? What about his school team? He won't play and train with them at all? Hope this all gets clearer in the next episode!<br  />
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-11" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-11">11 - はぐれ狼小次郎あらわる</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-11">
<p>
So, Tsubasa can only go to Brazil with Roberto if they win the national championship? I'm sad that there's no reasoning given at all for this. The show's flaws have been revealing themselves more and more the last episodes. I'm not sure if they have used more than three themes throughout the show so far, only one of which (the title theme) I really find appealing. But I'm hopeful this will approve a bit later down the road.<br  />
</p>

<p>
Hyuga's introduction is&#x2026; interesting. I like him quite a bit, but him showing up in Nankatsu seems strange. The rolled up sleeves is such a clever and recognizable feat of his personality, I'm excited to see him compete with Tsubasa and Genzo. Also, Ishizaki fight!<br  />
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-12" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-12">12 - めざせ! 日本一</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-12">
<p>
Ah! Finally we get the information why Tsubasa has to win the championship to be able to go to Brazil - it's the deal he struck with Roberto. Well, ok. On a more positive note, we get to learn more about Hyuga's background and his motivation to win the national championship.<br  />
</p>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/posts/tsubasa/tsubasa-season1-episode12.jpg" width="90%" style="display:block;margin:2em auto 2em;"/>

<p>
I like the idea of him "abandoning" his team. He knows fully well that he can't win the national championship by himself and needs the support of his teammates and by abandoning them in the regionals he is giving them the chance to step out of his shadow and realize their own potential.<br  />
