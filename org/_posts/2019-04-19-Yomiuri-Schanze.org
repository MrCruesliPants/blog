I recently picked up and continued my rewatch of the anime [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/2116/Captain_Tsubasa][/Captain Tsubasa/]]. Going through my previous posts and short episode descriptions, I remembered being strangely curious about the building the teams stayed in during the first big tournament. Oddly shaped, the building looked to me like it was built under ski jumping ramp â€“ a strange and specific construction that made me think it could be based on a real building in Japan. 

Wouldn't it be cool to find this building? Maybe I could even visit the place on our trip to Japan? Quite some time has passed since I first started this rewatch and among the more positive developments I've since become a little bit less scared of the Japanese language. Maybe I could find something this time? So, and since I apparently don't have better things to do, I set out to find this building I briefly saw in an anime from 1983.
